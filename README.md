An ongoing project to create a portfolio of stocks with known correlations. The idea being that you buy stocks with at least a 60% correlation to your choice reference whole market etf. 
The stocks in the portfolio are then beta weighted delta'd to the reference etf. 

This allows you to know the movement of your whole portfolio by just looking at the reference. For example if the reference moves 10 points and your potfolios beta weighted delta is 100, the your portfolio will move 1000 points. 

This initial preparation of the portfolio allows for better management of directional risk, by selling call options during market downturns and adding to your deltas for market uptrends, you can hedge your portfolio.
